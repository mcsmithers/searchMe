MarkerClustererPlus was created by Gary Little.\n * <p>\n * v2.0 release: MarkerClustererPlus v2.0 is backward compatible with MarkerClusterer v1.0. It\n *  adds support for the <code>ignoreHidden</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>batchSizeIE</code>,\n *  and <code>calculator</code> properties as well as support for four more events. It also allows\n *  greater control over the styling of the text that appears on the cluster marker.

Very large numbers of markers can now be managed without causing Javascript timeout\n *  errors on Internet Explorer.

The <code>styles</code> array element used has an index of\n *  <code>index</code> minus 1. For example, the default <code>calculator</code> returns a\n *  <code>text</code> value of <code>\"125\"</code> and an <code>index</code> of <code>3</code>\n *  for a cluster icon representing 125 markers so the element used in the <code>styles</code>\n *  array is <code>2</code>.

Icons such\n * as these look better when viewed on high-resolution monitors such as Apple's Retina displays.\n * Note: if this property is <code>true</code>, sprites cannot be used as cluster icons.\n * @property {number} [batchSize=MarkerClusterer.BATCH_SIZE] Set this property to the\n *  number of markers to be processed in a single batch when using a browser other than\n *  Internet Explorer (for Internet Explorer, use the batchSizeIE property instead).\n * @property {number} [batchSizeIE=MarkerClusterer.BATCH_SIZE_IE] When Internet Explorer is\n *  being used, markers are processed in several batches with a small delay inserted between\n *  each batch in an attempt to avoid Javascript timeout errors.

Very large numbers of markers can now be managed without causing Javascript timeout\n *  errors on Internet Explorer.
